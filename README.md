# CollegeDrapes

CollegeDrapes is an e-commerce website for selling custom-designed drapes and flags, specifically catering to college students and alumni. This project is built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend.

This is the first website I am developing, and I am learning as I go.
